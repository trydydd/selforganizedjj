Choose from our pre-built submission grappling class plans for structured skill development, or pick games ad hoc for a more flexible and varied training experience. Both options are designed to enhance your skill and understanding of submission grappling effectively.

For complete novices we recommend reading Stephan Kesting's [A Roadmap for Brazilian Jiu-jitsu](https://www.grapplearts.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Roadmap-for-BJJ-1.5-1.pdf). It will help familiarize you with grappling terminology quickly.

If you are not sure where to begin then the [lesson plans](/lesson_plans) are the best place to start as they all include links to video references.
