## Our Mission
Our goal is to increase the accessibility of submission grappling by providing resources, equipment, and curriculum. Just add a resisting partner, and you have the ability to learn these skills anywhere anytime -- even without a coach.

## How to Start
Choose from our pre-built submission grappling class plans for structured skill development, or pick games ad hoc for a more flexible and varied training experience. Both options are designed to enhance your skill and understanding of submission grappling effectively.

If you are not sure where to begin then the [foundations curriculum](/lesson_plans/slime_mold_grappling_club/foundations/) is where you should dive in! 

If you have questions or would like to contribute to the club, please [email us](mailto:social@slimemoldgrappling.com)!

## Community Support

If you are an individual athlete or a free club that does not charge member dues, and are intersted in a donation of equipment or one on one consulting time to build or troubleshoot your curriculum please reach out [here](mailto:social@slimemoldgrappling.com). We handle inquiries in the order that they are received and as funds are available -- please be patient if there is a delay. We are not ignoring anyone.
