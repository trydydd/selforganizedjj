This is the third and final newsletter in our goal setting series. I'm a sucker for a trilogy!

Today, we dive into the concept of the growth mindset and how it can accelerate your progress as an athlete or coach.
Fixed vs. Growth Mindset

The growth mindset is a term coined by psychologist Carol Dweck, and it refers to the belief that our abilities and intelligence can be developed through dedication and hard work. A fixed mindset is the belief that our talents and abilities are innate and unchangeable.

A fixed mindset might lead you to believe that you're either naturally talented or not, that your potential is limited, and that failures are a reflection of your value. A growth mindset recognizes that every setback is an opportunity to learn, every challenge is a chance to grow, and every plateau can become a stepping stone.

## Embracing Failure as a Learning Opportunity

One of the core tenets of the growth mindset is the willingness to embrace failure as a learning opportunity. In grappling, tapping or getting caught in a submission is not a reflection of your inadequacy; it's a valuable lesson that reveals areas for improvement.

Failures should be viewed as chances to analyze your weaknesses, create new strategies, and explore new solutions. Each tap is a signpost, guiding you towards the areas that require more focused attention and practice.

## Setting Goals for Growth

This is where our previous work on process goals comes into play. To cultivate a growth mindset, it's essential to shift your goal-setting approach. Rather than solely fixating on outcomes, such as winning competitions or achieving a specific belt rank, focus on setting process-oriented goals that prioritize continuous improvement.

For example, instead of setting a goal to reach a certain belt, set a goal to train or study at least three times per week -- every single week. This mindset shift ensures that your efforts are directed towards growth and mastery, rather than external validation.
Embracing Challenges

A growth mindset thrives on challenges. Rather than avoiding difficult opponents or situations, actively seek them out. Challenging yourself against higher-level athletes or experimenting with unfamiliar problems stretches your capabilities and accelerates your growth.

Remember, comfort zones are cozy but stagnant. It's only by stepping out of your comfort zone and embracing the discomfort of growth that you can truly progress.

## Final Thoughts

Cultivating a growth mindset in submission grappling is a journey of self-discovery and continuous improvement. It requires a shift in perspective, a willingness to embrace challenges, and a dedication to learning from every setback.

Remember that progress, much like learning, is rarely linear. By cultivating a growth mindset, you'll develop the resilience and determination to overcome these obstacles and emerge as a stronger, more adaptable athlete or coach.

So, the next time you step onto the mats to train, approach each roll, each tap, and each challenge with a mindset of growth, and watch as your skills grow.

See you on the mats!
