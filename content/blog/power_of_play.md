When working to pick up a new skill, it's easy to get caught up in the seriousness of training and coaching -- especially in combat sports. We often focus on training outcomes and feeling like we left it all on the mats. This means that one critical aspect of effective learning is often neglected: having fun.

## The Science of Play

Research in motor learning and skill acquisition has shown that including elements of play in order to increase the enjoyment of training can lead to better learning outcomes. When we are engaging in activities that we find inherently fun and rewarding, our brain releases dopamine. Dopamine is associated with motivation, attention, and memory formation. This means that by infusing our training with a sense of play we are priming our bodies to be more receptive to learning and skill development.
Intrinsic Motivation

Enjoyment is also a critical component of intrinsic motivation, which refers to the drive to engage in an activity for its own sake rather than being pushed to do so by external punishment or reward. When someone is intrinsically motivated, they are more likely to stick with an activity in the face of challenges, embrace the development process, and experience a sense of satisfaction and fulfillment.

## Practical Applications

So, how can we incorporate more fun and play into our submission grappling training? Here are a few tools that we can use:

* **Games**: Move away from repetitive techniques and towards gamified learning. Embrace frameworks like the constraints-led approach to increase engagement and play in training
* **Embrace Variety**: Mix up your training by using different training partners, styles of play, and environments. Have you grappled on sand yet? Why not?
* **Unstructured Play**: Set aside time for open mat sessions and casual rolls where the focus is on exploration and creativity. As one coach told me, "Just go out and try some meme shit sometime. Just have fun."

This applies to both coaches and athletes. How much do you enjoy your sessions? Why? 
Remember

The journey to mastery is not just about the destination, but also the quality of the experiences along the way. By embracing the power of play and prioritizing fun in our training, we open ourselves up to a world of accelerated learning, increased motivation, and longevity in sport.
