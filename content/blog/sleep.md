This week we're taking a look at how sleep can affect the gains we see from training.
The Learning-Sleep Connection

Research has shown that sleep has a positive impact on skill development. These positive effects have been documented in tasks ranging from video games to dance and juggling. One interesting trend worth noting is that the positive benefits of sleep appear to scale up as task complexity increases. The more complex the skill, the more gains you see while sleeping!

In the context of grappling, this means that the guard pass you just learned could actually be improving while you sleep. It's almost like your brain is getting in extra reps without your body suffering the physical punishment.

## Sleep and Recovery

The positive benefits of sleep go far beyond simple skill development. It's also crucial for physical recovery -- which we could all use more of. One study has shown that increasing sleep to 10 hours per night improved speed, accuracy, reaction times, and overall physical/mental well being in collegiate basketball players.

For grapplers, this translates to:

* Faster physical and mental recovery
* Reduced risk of injury and overtraining
* Enhanced focus and decision making on the mats
* Better emotional regulation and stress management

## Sleep and Hormones

I've saved the best for last -- the hormonal impacts of sleep. During the deep stages of sleep your body optimizes the levels of some hormones:

* **Growth Hormone**: GH Peaks during deep sleep and plays a large roll in muscle growth and tissue repair.
* **Testosterone**: Natural testosterone levels peak during REM sleep and plays a large role in muscle development and recovery.
* **Cortisol**: Sleep reduces cortisol levels, which helps reduce inflammation and promotes recovery.

To be blunt, good sleep is a natural performance enhancer that improves recovery, muscle growth, and general resilience. It's the closest that you can get to steroids without doing steroids.

## Practical Sleep Strategies

* Aim for 7-9 hours of sleep per night.
* Maintain a consistent sleep schedule.
* Create a relaxing pre-sleep routine.
* Avoid screens one hour before bed.
* Keep your sleeping environment cool, dark, and quiet.

## Conclusion

Remember, the mats are where you practice, but your bed is where you grow. Make sure to prioritize your time off the mats in ways that will maximize the gains you see from your time on them. The next time you're tempted to skip some sleep for an extra training session or that new Netflix series, remember: sometimes, the most beneficial thing you can do is lie down and close your eyes.
