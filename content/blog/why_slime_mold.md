Well, first, I chose the name without asking anyone else and I'm a nerd. Secondly, we primarily leverage the constraints-led approach and ecological dynamics to build effective practices. One key feature of these two frameworks is a focus on **self organization**.

Slime molds, particularly Physarum polycephalum, are an excellent example of **self-organizing systems**. They form decentralized networks, adapt to their environment, and optimize use of resources through the local interactions of their parts and the environment with no central control.
Not only can they perform complex tasks like solving mazes to find food, but they also optimize that solution for efficient resource acquisition. They even leave markers to prevent the repetition of suboptimal solutions.

Don't be like water -- be like slime mold.
