**Top Player**:
  * **Position**: On your knees with your partner's bottom leg between yours and your chest pressing against the knee of their top leg. Their hands should be connected to your body in any configuration they want.
  * **Objective**: Remove the knee shield.
  * **Constraints**: You can alleviate pressure to manipulate the frame, but cannot flee the engagement.
  * **Win Condition**: The knee shield is no longer between you and your partner.

**Bottom Player**:
  * **Position**: On one side with your bottom leg inside your partner's knees, your top knee should be touching their upperbody, and your hands/arms should be touching their body in any configuration you'd like.
  * **Objective**: Force your partner's hands to touch the mat, and then punish the post by connecting your hips to their shoulderline or establishing a two-on-one grip.
  * **Constraints**: None
  * **Win Condition**: Hips are connected to your partner's shoulders or a two on one grip has been established.
