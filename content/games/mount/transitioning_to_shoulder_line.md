**Top Player**:
  * **Position**: Mounted on top of your partner.

  * **Win Condition**: Partner's elbows are exposed and extended or contracted.

**Bottom Player**:
  * **Position**: Underneath your partner's mount.
  * **Objective**: Keep your hands pointed at your partner's hips, work to destabilize your partner, and bring your knees back in front.
  * **Constraints**: None
  * **Win Condition**: Knees are brought back in front of your partner.
