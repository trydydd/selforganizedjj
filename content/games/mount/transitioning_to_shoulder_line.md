**Top Player**:
  * **Position**: Sitting on top of your partner straddling their torso.
  * **Objective**: Trap your partner's wrist to the floor either on the same side or the cross side of their head to expose the elbows.

  * **Constraints**: No submissions -- only wrist pinning allowed.
  * **Win Condition**: Partner's elbows are exposed and extended or contracted.

**Bottom Player**:
  * **Position**: On your back with your opponent straddling your torso.
  * **Objective**: Keep your hands pointed at your partner's hips, work to destabilize your partner, and bring your knees back in front.
  * **Constraints**: None
  * **Win Condition**: Knees are brought back in front of your partner.
