**Top Player**:
  * **Position**: Standing while straddling your supine partner with the top of your head touching the mat in their armpit. Their arm should be wrapped around your neck with their hands connected. The position should be uncomfortable, but you should not be getting actively choked.
  * **Objective**: Focus on freeing your head from the submission using movement and by fighting their hands.
  * **Constraints**: None
  * **Win Condition**: Freeing your head and getting your legs back between you and your partner or standing for 3 seconds.

**Bottom Player**:
  * **Position**: Laying on the ground belly up with your partner's feet on either side of your body and with their head on the mat in your armpit. Your arm should wrap around their neck and your hands should be connected. 
  * **Objective**: Maintain control of your opponent without actively choking them. When they escape the guillotine finish with any other submission before the scramble ends.
  * **Constraints**: Do not finish the guillotine.
  * **Win Condition**: Tapping your partner with any submission except the guillotine that you started with.

Reset if top player wins.
