These lessons can be used while you build the skill to create your own games that are more tailored to your participants.

Each of these plans will have an attribution section if they were created by anyone outside of our club. Any lessons that have not been thoroughlyt tested will be tagged with "untested". You can see the tags at the top of each page.

Here are some recommendations:

**Round length**:

* Beginner: 3 minute rounds.

* Intermediate: 5 minute rounds.

* Advanced: 10 minute rounds.

These recommendations are based on experience as well as recommendations from coach Greg Souders at [Standard Jiu Jitsu](https://standardjiujitsu.com). 

Round length and rest duration can both be adjusted to modulate intensity and ensure participants spend enough time working through problems to develop skill.

Round counts should be adjusted to suit your session length. 

**Variability**: Ensure to include variability in your training. This will lengthen the skill acquisition phase of learning for individual skills, but will also ultimately result in more retention and transfer in real performances. This could be including a game unrelated to the rest of class at the end, varying the games within a class, or adjusting how much time you spend focused on each position/submission/movement. 


Be sure to include time for feedback and at least occasional no-constraint live rounds.
