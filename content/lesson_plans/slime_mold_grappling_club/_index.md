These are combinations of constrained games that are used for training at the Slime Mold Grappling Club that are meant to be bite sized introductions to the way that we train.

We work to leverage the constraints-led approach and ecological dynamics to maximize both the enjoyment and efficiency of our mat time. 

Sessions are generally one hour long and in a format that suits adult participants of all fitness and skill levels. 

Classes are broken into the three macro situations of submission grappling: standing, pinning, and guard.
