This set of class plans uses a block training structure. The easiest way to get started using this in your training is to focus on each situation for one week.

Each plan consists of three games that focus on the same macro situation (standing, guard, or pinning). 

The last two games are focused on a separate macro situation and used for the variability of practice effect. 

Each session ends with at least one live round. Round length varies depending on the ability of the athletes in the room.
