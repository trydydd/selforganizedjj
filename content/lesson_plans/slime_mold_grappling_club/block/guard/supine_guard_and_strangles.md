Each game consists of a three minute round, a one minute break, and then another three minute round with the position of the players switched. 

Any games without win conditions are continuous in nature -- the game lasts until the round ends.

**6 Minute Round**

Live round with a partner. Start standing if you are able to do so safely. Otherwise pick the starting position from one of the previous games and start there. Roll to submission, reset, and continue. Repeat as many times as possible before the round ends.
