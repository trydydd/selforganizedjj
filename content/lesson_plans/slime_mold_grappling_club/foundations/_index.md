This is out twelve week foundations curriculum. It is designed to produce well rounded athletes who are capable of playing the entire game of submission grappling with opponents of varying skill levels. We will be providing three full lessons per week. Feel free to use them as they are or modify them in any way that makes the material more approachable and manageable for you.

This curriculum is specifically meant to be used by either athletes or coaches.

Over the course of twelve weeks we will cover the following:

* Standing situations
* Pinning situations
* Guarded situations
* Naked Chokes
* Arm Chokes
* Straight Arm Locks
* Twisting Arm Locks
* Straight Leg Locks
* Twisting Leg Locks

Standing, Pinning, and Guarded situations all get a one week focus. This pattern will repeat every three weeks for all twelve weeks of the program.

Each week will also have a submission focus so that students are able to play the full game of submission grappling in every single session.
