This is the first three weeks of our twelve week foundations curriculum. The first six weeks is focused on pinning, guard, and submissions.

Standing engagements will be introduced in the second half of the curriculum.

The full twelve week curriculum is designed to produce well rounded athletes who are capable of playing the entire game of submission grappling with opponents of varying skill levels. There are three sessions per week. Feel free to use them as they are or modify them in any way that makes the material more approachable and manageable for you.

This curriculum is specifically meant to be used by either athletes or coaches.

Over the course of twelve weeks we will cover the following:

* Standing situations
* Pinning situations
* Guarded situations
* Naked Chokes
* Arm Chokes
* Straight Arm Locks
* Twisting Arm Locks
* Straight Leg Locks
* Twisting Leg Locks

For the first six weeks we will alternate between focusing on guarded and pinning situations. 

Standing situations will be introduced in the second six weeks of the curriculum.

One new submission will be covered in each week.
