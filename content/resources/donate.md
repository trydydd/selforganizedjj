First, to be transparent, the club is not a nonprofit.

With that out of the way, any donations will go directly to covering the costs of running the site (hosting, domain registraion, etc), and improvements if demand should ever exceed what our current hosting arrangement can meet. Any excess after that will be used to provide community support for folks or organizations who are in need within the grappling community.

If that sounds interesting to you, please click the button below to donate via Paypal.
