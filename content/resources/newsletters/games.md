### Background: Where Did This Come From?
Our framework is loosely based on the scientific method. There are 6 steps, and it works even if you have little to no experience -- so long as you stick to the process! That said, there is one core principle that we need to get out of the way before starting:

**All games require an intelligently resisting opponent.**

With that, let's dive into the framework.

### SMGC Games Framework

* Observation: Identifying the Problem. What negative situation are you failing to escape/prevent or what desirable outcome are you unable to reach?

* Question: Understanding the Cause. What is my opponent doing to cause that?

* Hypothesis: Create a Solution. If I prevent my opponent from doing what is in the answer to the question above, then I should be able to achieve my goal.

* Experiment: Testing Your Solution. Put yourself into a situation with your partner, and test your hypothesis.

* Analyze: Evaluate Results. Were you able to perform or prevent the actions specified in your hypothesis? If yes, were you also able to reach your desired outcome?

* Repeat: Solving the Next Problem. If the answer to either of those questions is no: repeat the process. The information in the "Review Outcomes" step becomes your Observation.

### The Example

* **Observation**: I am constantly stuck in bottom side control.
* **Question**: What is preventing me from escaping?
* **Hypothesis**: The crossface is preventing me from being able to move effectively. I think that if I can get some part of my body in between us and relieve the cross face I'll be able to escape.
* **Experiment**: Start in side control with a fully established crossface. Your partner's goal is to maintain their crossface. Your goal is to find a way to bring some part of your body in between you and your partner to relieve the pressure from their crossface.
* **Review Outcomes**: I was successfully able to remove their crossface, but they were still able to prevent me from escaping. I could move, but any time I attempted an escape my partner just followed me and maintained the pin.
* **Iterate**: Now "when I try to escape side control my partner prevents it by following my movement to maintain the pin" can be fed back into the observation step, and the process can be ran again. This repeats until you have successfully solved your problem!

### Important Notes

There's a piece missing here, and that's not by accident. Generally there is a research phase. I wanted to start by focusing on how learners can use their experience as the source for creating games in order to solve their own problems. We can only almost always search the internet for solutions to our problems -- not quite always.

When you have the option you should absolutely use outside resources like feedback from more experienced athletes and instructionals to help guide the creation of your games. When doing this try to be aware of the quality of the information that you are using to inform your practice. If you're unsure how to do this, just stick to well known names in your sport for now. The good news is that if you do find something that is a bad tip -- it should fail to achieve your desired outcome, and you'll just end up repeating the process with different information!
Different Experience Levels

For novices this framework is effective because it allows them iterate on a problem while actively searching for solutions that they are not aware of. In this case the process is physical, and takes a lot of time. For more experienced athletes this process can sometimes be completed as a thought process without needing to physically explore the problem space. The ability to do this will come with time, and if you're struggling as a novice -- stick with it!

##S An Alternative Method

This straight forward method was created by the user Breanne on the Ecological Dynamics Discord server. That link is an invite. You should join!

### 4-Part Problem Solving Framework for Self-Directed Learners

1) What's the situation you're struggling with?
2) What exactly is the problem you're having? What are you unable to prevent and/or what are you not able to make them do?
3) What impact would solving that problem (#2) help you in that situation (#1)?
4) What is the opponent do that is preventing you from doing what you want to?

### Game Framework

In this game, we're going to start in (situation #1). Player A, your job is to (do the opposite of #3) so that you can (general goal of this player, from this position). Player B, your job is to (do #4) so that you can (general goal of this player, from this position).

### Example

Situation is I'm in bottom mount
Problem is my frames keep getting collapsed
When my frames get collapsed, they are able to move their hips up my torso
My frames are getting collapsed because they keep pinning my arms

### Resulting Game

In this game, we're going to start in mount (#1). Bottom player, your job is to push on your partner's hips (opposite of #3) so that you can get your legs back between you and your partner (the general goal of a pinned bottom player). Top player, your job is to pin the bottom player's arms (#4) and stay on top (general goal of top player in all situations).
