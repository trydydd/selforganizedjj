**Adaptability**: Ability to modify actions in response to changing conditions or constraints.

**Affordance**: An opportunity for action presented by the environment.

**Challenge Point**: The level of task difficulty required to optimize learning.

**Constraint**: Something in the environment, task, or learner that shapes how they move or act.

**Constraints-Led Approach**: Using environmental, task, and individual constraints to guide learning and performance.

**Dynamic Systems Theory**: Framework for understanding how complex systems change over time.

**Emergent Behavior**: Spontaneous creation of new movement patterns in response to constraints.

**Environmental Constraints**: External physical and social factors that influence movement possibilities.

**Exploratory Learning**: Learning through trial, error, and discovery.

**Feedback Loops**: Processes where outcomes influence future actions or decisions.

**Functional Variability**: Useful variations in movement that achieve a task goal.

**Individual Constraints**: Personal attributes like body size and mental state that affect movement and performance.

**Interpersonal Coordination**: Adjusting one's movements in response to others.

**Invariant**: An unchanging element within various movements or actions.

**Motor Learning**: The process of acquiring and refining movement skills.

**Nonlinear Pedagogy**: An instructional approach emphasizing exploration and variability in learning.

**Perception-Action Coupling**: The connection between perceiving environmental information and executing movement.

**Rate Limiter**: A factor that restricts the development or performance of a skill.

**Representative Learning Design**: Practice designs that mimic the performance context.

**Representativeness**: How well training mirrors the challenges of the performance environment.

**Self-Organization**: The natural tendency of learners to adapt their behavior to the constraints encountered.

**Skill Acquisition**: Developing new abilities or techniques through practice and experience.

**Task Constraints**: Specific goals, rules, or equipment that shape how a task is performed.

**Variability of Practice**: Using different practice conditions to enhance learning over time.
