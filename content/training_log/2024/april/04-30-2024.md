Place an object on the opposite side of the mats. We used a towel. 

Start with one player in turtle and the other player with their arms locked around their partner's waist. The defending player's goal is to touch the towel with any part of their body at all. The attacking player's job is to prevent their partner from touching the object. Submissions are allowed. 

Reset if one player taps or if the defending player reaches the object.

**6 Minute Round**

Live round with a partner. Start standing if you are able to do so safely. Otherwise pick the starting position from one of the previous games and start there. Roll to submission, reset, and continue. Repeat as many times as possible before the round ends.
