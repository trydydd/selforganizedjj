**3 Minute Rounds**

The first game needs to be updated to include a win condition for both players and a reset. 

Knee tag worked well, but should be rewritten so that only one player is actively attacking the knees at a time to reduce injury potential in inexperienced participants.

Snapdowns were the least effective game with far more failure than success. It should be reworked to include more room for success for the attacking player.
