IP session drilling heel hook entries from bottom half guard. 

Open rounds. 

Third parties reported noticable improvement in club members since the last open mat ~ 2 weeks ago. 

I pushed past a reasonable level of exhaustion and into sloppy movement space. Rest rounds would be beneficial for safety and skill acquisition reasons.
