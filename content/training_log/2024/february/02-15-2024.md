**6 Minute Round**

Live round with a partner. Start standing if you are able to do so safely. Otherwise pick the starting position from one of the previous games and start there. Roll to submission, reset, and continue. Repeat as many times as possible before the round ends. 

Triangle game worked out well but will need to be polished for public consumption. 

Sweeps are beginning to emerge more regularly!
