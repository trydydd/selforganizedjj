**Two 3 Minute Rounds**

Live round with a partner. Start standing if you are able to do so safely. Otherwise pick the starting position from one of the previous games and start there. Roll to submission, reset, and continue. Repeat as many times as possible before the round ends. 

We should start shifting sessions to include more submission work.
