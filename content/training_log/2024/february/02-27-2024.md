**3 Minute Rounds**

Live round with a partner. Start standing if you are able to do so safely. Otherwise pick the starting position from one of the previous games and start there. Roll to submission, reset, and continue. Repeat as many times as possible before the round ends. 


**Notes**
We should take some time to focus on maintaining positions and spend a week with a tighter focus on submissions. 

Movement and transitions are happening but folks continue to struggle with finishing and control from dominant positions.
