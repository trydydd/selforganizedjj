**3 Minute Rounds**

Live round with a partner. Start standing if you are able to do so safely. Otherwise pick the starting position from one of the previous games and start there. Roll to submission, reset, and continue. Repeat as many times as possible before the round ends. 


**Notes**
We didn't have a prepared practice this time around. The games worked out well but could be improved. 

These should be written down and a focus should be put on improving the focus of attention and intention.
