## Open Mat

We're using a local club open mat to add training variability by introducing new opponents of varying skill levels. 

Sticking points for folks this time around were:

* closed guard (submissions, transitions)
* leg entanglements
* sweeps/reversals
* head and arm strangle finishes 

This will resolve itself in time as we use the reworked format for training that includes more variability week to week. 

We'll also be using this data to adjust some task constraints and choose constrained scenarios for the sessions over the next few weeks.
