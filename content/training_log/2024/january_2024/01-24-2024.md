## Open Mat

We're using a local club open mat to add training variability by introducing new opponents of varying skill levels. 

Sticking points for folks this time around were exclusively focused in areas that we have spent little or no time in during our sessions:

* closed guard
* leg entanglements
* sweeps/reversals

We'll be using this data to adjust some of our constraints, win conditions, and the focus of games in the next few weeks.
