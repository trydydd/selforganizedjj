Differential learning session ran completely on sand. This was involuntary as we did not have access to mats. We should consider making this a regular part of training. The new terrain and movement of sand injects a large amount of variability into the process and forces alternative solutions to familiar problems.

I suspect that controlling someone in a shifting environment like sand will translate well into increased ability to control a partner in a more stable setting.

The live round at the end was skipped due to time constraints that were nonnegotiable.
