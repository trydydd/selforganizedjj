**Drill 2: Schultz Choke & Anaconda from Front Headlock**

**3 Minute Unconstrained Rounds**

Today was a community session led by another instructor. We start with a front headlock go behind drill, played a front headlock constrained game, a Schultz choke/anaconda from chin strap drill, and then unconstrained rounds. 

We also reviewed lockdown and its use to prevent crossface and pressure in bottom half guard.
