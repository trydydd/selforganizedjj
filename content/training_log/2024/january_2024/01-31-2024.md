This scenario is poorly designed and should be reworked. Instead of using such a high level of specificity it should just encourage connection to the legs and pin prevention.

**6 Minute Round**

Live round with a partner. Start standing if you are able to do so safely. Otherwise pick the starting position from one of the previous games and start there. Roll to submission, reset, and continue. Repeat as many times as possible before the round ends.

**Periodization Phase**: Coordination

The seated guard games that we created were too complex and poorly constrained to be useful. They should all be rewritten.
