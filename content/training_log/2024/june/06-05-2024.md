Open mat with Tim from [The Black Dog](https://theblackdogjiujitsu.com/)

Covered saddle entries from quarter guard to clover lock/heel hook. 

Notes:

Essentially back step with the top leg, sit back, and collect their legs. They either have to open their legs to prevent the back step, or keep your foot trapped and allow it. Love a dilemma.
