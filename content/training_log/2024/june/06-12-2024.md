Open mat with Tim from [The Black Dog](https://theblackdogjiujitsu.com/)

Covered kimuras and crucifix entries from side control using a figure four grip on the far side arm leading to triangles. 

Notes: Some of our folks haven't connected upper body/lower body movement. We should run some games focused on skills using the legs to do things like pendulum and knee levers.
