There were only two of us today, but this set of games went much better than the first time we played through them. Using the leg as a hook to hang your bodyweight off of TP and the lat grab were both commonly used to facilitate rotation around to the back. 

Folks did a much better job clearing the arms and getting outside the elbows even if they were not able to capitalize on it very often. Everyone was far more mobile as guard player.

Add more games with a larger variety of wins to create more di/trilemmas for paths to the back.
