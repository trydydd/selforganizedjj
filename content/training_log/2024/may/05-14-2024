**6 Minute Round**

Live round with a partner. Start standing if you are able to do so safely. Otherwise pick the starting position from one of the previous games and start there. Roll to submission, reset, and continue. Repeat as many times as possible before the round ends.

Demos of specific connections were helpful for when I was having a difficult time communicating the importance of hip connection and having your partner carry your weight from the bottom. 
Pinning has improved significantly -- specifically timing and transitions.
