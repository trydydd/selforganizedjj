Open mat with Tim from [The Black Dog](https://theblackdogjiujitsu.com/)

Leg entries vs supine guard player.
* straight ankle lock
* aoki lock

Approx 1 hour 10 minutes of open rounds. 

Notes: 

Leg entries vs guarded players by stepping in and sitting back to attack the legs.
Folks who regularly attend our sessions are getting more comfotable with getting **under** opponents, but we need to work on creating elevation and space to increase opportunities for attacking the legs.
