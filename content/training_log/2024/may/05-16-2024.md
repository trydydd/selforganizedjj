**6 Minute Round**

Live round with a partner. Start standing if you are able to do so safely. Otherwise pick the starting position from one of the previous games and start there. Roll to submission, reset, and continue. Repeat as many times as possible before the round ends.

The cues for the defending player are not sufficient in the twisting armlock games.

Folks continue to make progress with back takes, reversals and escapes. Spend more time in side control without underhooks.
