Start with your partner inside your closed guard and with a head and arm grip (arm triangle). Attacking player works to sweep or submit. Defending player works to remove their head and arm from the situation and stand.

**6 Minute Rounds**

Live round with a partner. Start standing if you are able to do so safely. Otherwise pick the starting position from one of the previous games and start there. Roll to submission, reset, and continue. Repeat as many times as possible before the round ends.

Grip fighting while in the guard continues to improve. We saw more movement and angles in this round than the last.

We are also starting to see much more movement and fluidity in the open rounds at the end of sessions. 

Everyone still needs to work on being more exploratory in rounds and less focused on winning.
