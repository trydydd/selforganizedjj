**6 Minute Round**

Live round with a partner. Start standing if you are able to do so safely. Otherwise pick the starting position from one of the previous games and start there. Roll to submission, reset, and continue. Repeat as many times as possible before the round ends.

The last game (Hip to Shoulder Connection) is poorly constrained for top player. The game should be rewritten so that back takes are more accessible. As it is you kind of end up in a sweeping game, which is great but not the intention.
