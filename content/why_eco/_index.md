The ecological approach to training is effective because it focuses on learning through real game-like situations, helping athletes develop quick and smart reactions. This method improves decision-making skills and adaptability, as it teaches athletes to respond to the ever-changing dynamics of their sport. Additionally, it leads to better long-term skill retention and versatility, as athletes learn to apply their skills in various contexts, not just memorize set techniques.
