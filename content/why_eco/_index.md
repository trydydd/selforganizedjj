The ecological approach to training is effective because it focuses on learning through real performance situations, helping athletes develop the ability to effectively perceive and react to information in their environment. This method improves decision-making skills and adaptability, as it teaches athletes to respond to the ever-changing dynamics of the sport. Additionally, it leads to better long-term skill retention and versatility, as athletes learn to apply their skills in various contexts, not just memorize set techniques.
